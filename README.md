# AirPolutionSensor_GP2Y1010AU0F_ATMega328
This short program allows to make simple air pollution sensor. Looking at hardware it needs only 2x16 LCD44780 display and 4 buttons. It handles 4-bit LCD interface. 

GP2Y1010AU0F air pollution sensor is poor quality and I recommend this example only for learning how to handle analogue sensors, simple LCD menus, etc. Comparing to SDS011 dust sensor there is no point in using this sensor. I made this project as my engineering thesis that is why costs of project was one of the most imporatant issue.
